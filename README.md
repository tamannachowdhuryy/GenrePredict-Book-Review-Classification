# GenrePredict-Book-Review-Classification


GenrePredict: Book Review Classification is a machine learning project I developed for my Breakthrough Tech AI class over the summer. The project aims to predict the genres of books based on their reviews by leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and various machine learning models. The dataset consists of book reviews, which are vectorized using TF-IDF. The models used include a neural network implemented with TensorFlow and Keras, Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Classifier. The project encompasses data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, achieving high accuracy in genre prediction from textual data. This experience provided valuable insights into the practical applications of AI in text classification.
